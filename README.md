# Opening Range Breakout (ORB) Strategy – Python Backtest & Power BI Analytics

## Project Overview
This project consists of two phases:
1. Python-based backtesting of an Opening Range Breakout (ORB) intraday trading strategy on 5-minute stock data.
2. Power BI dashboard for in-depth performance analytics and visualization of the ORB strategy results.

## 1: Python – ORB Strategy Backtest
### 🎯 Objective
Backtest a simple Opening Range Breakout strategy using 5-minute intraday stock data.

### 📂 Input
File: market_data.csv
Columns:
currentdate – Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
currenttime – Time (HH:MM)
high, low, close – OHLC prices
symbol – Ticker symbol

### 📊 Strategy Logic
Opening Range: First 5-minute candle of each trading day
Buy Signal: Price breaks above the first candle’s high
Sell Signal: Price breaks below the first candle’s low
Trade Constraints:
Max 1 Buy and 1 Sell per symbol per day
Target: +0.5%
Stop Loss: -0.25%
Time Exit: 15:15 (if TP/SL not hit)

### 📝 Output
File: trade_log.csv
Fields Logged:
Date
Symbol
Trade Type (Buy/Sell)
Entry Time / Price
Exit Time / Price
PnL %
Exit Reason (Target/SL/Time)

This CSV will be used for Power BI analysis.

## 2: Power BI – ORB Strategy Analysis Dashboard
### 🎯 Objective
Visualize and analyze the ORB strategy performance using Power BI dashboards and calculated KPIs.

### 📥 Input
File: trade_log.csv (generated by Python script)

### 🧮 Calculated Columns
Trade Count per Day
Weekday (Mon–Sun)
Cumulative PnL
Drawdown (decline from peak cumulative PnL)
Holding Duration (in minutes)
Entry Hour (hour from entry time)

### 📈 KPIs (Cards)
Total PnL
Total Trades
Win Count
Loss Count
Maximum Drawdown
Average Drawdown
Expectancy = Avg Win × Win Rate + Avg Loss × Loss Rate
Calmar Ratio = Total PnL / Max Drawdown
Average Win PnL
Average Loss PnL
Win/Loss Ratio
Longest Win Streak
Longest Loss Streak

### 📊 Visualizations
Cumulative PnL – Line Chart
Drawdown – Line Chart
Win vs Loss – Pie Chart
Month-wise PnL – Bar Chart
Weekday-wise PnL – Bar Chart
Hourly PnL – Heatmap
Exit Reason PnL – Pie Chart
Trade Duration Distribution – Histogram
Top 5 Winning Trades – Table
Top 5 Losing Trades – Table

## How to Run the Project
▶️ Step 1: Backtest using Python
```
bash
python orb_backtest.py
```
This will generate trade_log.csv in the same directory.

📊 Step 2: Load in Power BI
Open ORB_Analysis.pbix in Power BI Desktop.
Replace trade_log.csv source with your newly generated file (if needed).
Refresh the data to populate all visuals and KPIs.
